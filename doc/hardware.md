Definitions
-----------

We define 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right' as relative to the FPGA orientation - ie.,
top is towards the 'A' row of balls, bottom towards 'T', left towards the '1' column of balls
and right towards '16'.

Power
-----

The PCB requires a 5V power supply only. You can either use the standard 4-pin
[disk-drive Molex connector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex_connector#Disk_drive) on J501, or you can use
the 2 terminals of J500. The top terminal of J500 is 5V, the bottom is GND.


JTAG
----

The board seems to have no exposed JTAG pins. However, there are marked test pads / vias on the front of the board, underneat silkscreen, to the top-right of the FPGA.

See [Getting Started](getting_started/getting_started.md) for detailed instructions on how to wire up the JTAG interface.

SPI Flash
---------

The SPI flash holding the configuration memory (U2) seems to be accessible via JP5, but this was not yet tested. The flash I/Os are connected through 33Î© resistors. The PROG_B signal has to be shorted to GND in order to access the SPI flash.

Buffers
-------

All I/O Buffers are 5V. Buffers U600 to U607 have a direction pin at F13.

| F13 | Buffer Direction |
|-----|------------------|
| 0   | Output           |
| 1   | Input            |

LED, Button
-----------

There is a general purpose, FPGA controlled LED at F7, active low (FPGA pin should be set to open drain).

Additionally, there is a button (S1). When F7 is an input, pressing the button will read low, otherwise it will read high. Pressing the button will [also always illuminate the LED](https://github.com/q3k/chubby75/issues/8).

Connector J600
--------------

Located on bottom of board.

Pin 1 labeled with arrow on top silkscreen layer. Pins are marked alternating, ie. pin 1
is the top-right corner of the connector, pin 2 is bottom-right, pin 49 top-left and pin 50 bottom-left.
